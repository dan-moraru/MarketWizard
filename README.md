# Market Wizard

## Overview

Financial markets constantly shift between different regimes; calm, volatile, stressed, or dominated by high-frequency trading. Trading strategies that perform well in one regime often fail catastrophically in another.

Market Wizard is a real-time market intelligence system that classifies market regimes using microstructure signals instead of attempting unreliable price prediction.

Rather than forecasting prices, Market Wizard answers a more important question:

What kind of market are we trading in right now?

This enables safer, adaptive trading systems that respond to instability before losses occur.

## Features

- Real-time ingestion of bid/ask market data
- Microstructure feature engineering
- Market regime classification using XGBoost
- Supports multiple regimes:
    - Normal market
    - Stressed market
    - HFT-dominated market
    - Flash events

We use an XGBoost multi-class classifier trained on engineered microstructure features.

Key design choices:

- Relative features instead of absolute prices
- Rolling statistical features
- Regime classification instead of price prediction
- This produces highly stable and explainable results.

## Findings

During development and live testing, we uncovered two important market microstructure flaws in the simulation environment. Identifying and adapting to these behaviors became a critical part of our strategy design.

### Bug 1 - Crossed-Spread Instant Fill Exploit

We discovered that the simulator allows a BUY order to be filled at any price inside the bid–ask spread, as long as it is above the best bid. Likewise, a SELL order inside the spread is filled as long as it is below the best ask.

This creates an unintended arbitrage loop:

- Buy at bid + 0.01
- Sell at ask - 0.01
- Both orders fill instantly

This produces risk-free infinite profit, even in the normal_market regime where prices barely move.

In real financial markets, this is impossible:

- BUY orders only execute at the best ask or higher
- SELL orders only execute at the best bid or lower

This bug effectively removes the spread as a trading cost, breaking a core principle of market microstructure.

### Bug 2 - No Order Cancellation Mechanism

We also found that the exchange provides no mechanism to cancel resting limit orders.

As a result:

- Orders placed far from the market may never fill
- These “zombie orders” accumulate silently
- The system eventually hits the 50 open order limit and disconnects

This forced us to implement internal risk controls to throttle order flow and manage outstanding orders.
